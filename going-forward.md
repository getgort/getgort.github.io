# Going Forward: Features to Look Forward To

The following is a list of major features that are planned for version 1.0:

1. **Triggers.** Allow Gort to execute existing bundled commands [in response to non-command chat input](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/117). (Priority: very high)
1. **Dynamic command configuration.** Allow dynamic values like tokens and passwords to be [securely passed to commands at runtime](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/114). (Priority: very high)
1. **Custom webhooks.** Expose [custom (auth-gated) RESTful endpoints](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/118) that can be used to execute existing bundled commands. (Priority: high)
1. **Easing Rule and Permission Design**. Addition of a command-line [rule tester](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/35). (Priority: high)
1. **Two-factor authentication.** Add support for [two-factor authentication](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/132). (Priority: high)
1. **Dual authorization.** Add support for [dual (two-person) authorization](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/131). (Priority: high)
1. **Simplifying audit log access.** Create a [`gort logs` command](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/156). (Priority: medium-high)
1. **Internal key/value store.** Allow commands access to [an internally-scoped key/value store](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/128) to maintain state, a little like HTTP cookies. (Priority: medium)
1. **Support for other chat platforms.** [Microsoft Teams](https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/121) first, others TBD (Priority: medium-low)
