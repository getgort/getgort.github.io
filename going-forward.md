# Going Forward: Features to Look Forward To

The following is a list of major features that are expected prior to version 1.0:

1. **Dynamic command configuration.** Will allow setting of sensitive values like tokens or passwords for commands. (Priority: very high)
1. **Kubernetes support.** The ability to spawn workers using the K8S API instead of requiring a Docker port (Priority: high)
1. **Remote bundles.** The ability to install bundles that are defined in remote repositories. (Priority: medium)
1. **Response formatting** Will allow custom output formatting to make things pretty. (Priority: medium)
1. **Support for other chat platforms.** Which ones though? (Priority: unknown)
1. **Triggers.** Allow Gort to execute pre-defined commands in response to non-command chats input. (Priority: unknown)
1. **Webhooks.**  Expose custom (auth-gated) RESTful endpoints that can be used to execute pre-defined commands. (Priority: unknown)
